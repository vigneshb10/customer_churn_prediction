A companyâ€™s profitability is affected by many things, but none are more important than customer retention. The ability to develop and retain a loyal customer base is a top goal for every company, and learning methods that help you reduce and prevent customer churn can be invaluable.
To reduce customer churn, companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, Web-based transactions, and social media interactions, to mention a few.

As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.
